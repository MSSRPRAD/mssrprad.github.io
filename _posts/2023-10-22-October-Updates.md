# Hello There!

Have been thinking about buying a domain name for myself and linking it to pages. Would cost around 800rs per year but maybe it's worth it. Also this site is static but the Oracle Cloud Free Tier would allow me to have a dynamic site though I'm unsure as to whether it's worth it.....

## Logs

Took a look at my August Updates and I can't even remember writing it.

- I never did the CSES after that :[

- I did finish the crossword soon after that but it's not completely ready yet. It needs some css work and have to add an option to download the crossword as a pdf.

- As for the twitter clone, it is more of a simple crud backend than a twitter clone. The only things remotely remarkable in it are the session based auth using redis and the functions to fetch the tweets in the timeline and tweet chains. Without WebSockets it doesn't make much sense and the frontend isn't ready yet.

- I did learn a lot while doing the project. Truly understanding the value of Rust now. It feels like a downgrade now using SQLAlchemy after using the sqlx crate for example. (The ability to check if the orm structs are matching the database schema is very powerful for eg!)

- As for the Ramayana, now I am in the 48th sarga. I switched over to [IITK-Ramayana](https://www.valmiki.iitk.ac.in/) from [Ambuda](https://ambuda.org/) because the latter doesn't have the correct order of padas often and many remarkable verses are missing. Hope to finish it soon.

- As for CUDA, I found out that the easiest solution is just installing PopOs Nvidia Spin. After doing that I realized I am not using the drivers as much as I fantasized I would be using them so I switched back to my more comfortable Fedora Sway Spin :)


## What Next?

- Design a nice API for the Chandas library. Also make a web-app to demonstrate it (something that's more interactive than Shreevatsa sir's site)

- LeetCode Grind

- Finish Ramayana this month
