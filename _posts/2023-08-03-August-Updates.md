# Hello There!

I wish I could have said I got a lot of work done over the last two months or that I learnt a lot of new skills. Sadly that was not the case (surprise surprise). 

### Logs:

- Started solving the CSES problemset. Finished the Introductory Problems and am halfway through the Dynamic Programming ones. [Just coping right now saying 'something is better than nothing'].
- Got some work done on the __Twitter-Clone__ application. It has a not-so-bad backend and, I admit, a bad frontend. Have implemented the Register, Login, Post, Comment, Follow functionalities in the frontend. Some more work needs to be done on this but it feels boring now. I did not use anything fancy like Websockets or SSE's because 1. They are tough to implement in Rust 2. It's not a production grade application anyway.
- Started Reading the Ramayana, in Sanskrit using the [Ambuda](https://ambuda.org/) website which provides पदच्छेद and easy dictionary searching for the meanings. I am also reading the English translation from [IITK-Ramayana](https://www.valmiki.iitk.ac.in/) simultaneously. I am in the 29Th सर्ग right now. I will make a separate post with my thoughts on this some other time.

### Next Steps
- Grind through CSES and regularly attempt Codeforces.
- Looking forward to reading the विश्वामित्र story in the Ramayana and also the कुमारसम्भवम् story which is nearer.
- Finish my Crossword program.
- Going through https://rentry.org/llm-training  and learning how LLM's work.
- Get CUDA setup on my PC by some chad when I return to the Campus.
