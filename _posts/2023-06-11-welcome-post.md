# Welcome!

This is my personal website which I will try to maintain regularly. I will be posting some blog articles over the next few months here and share some parts of my work and life.

As for **why** have a personal website, I have thought about it and :

- It is good for your mental health to write frequently and you get to organize your thoughts more often.
- It gives me an excuse to actually stop wasting time on mindless internet scrolling and actually do something productive instead.
- It is too easy (and free!) to make and host one nowadays that there is no excuse to not have one.
_Edit: I'm sorry it is not that easy to make and host one. React is spawn of Satan. Leaving this here for posterity._
- Even if it amounts to nothing at least I have gained some technical knowledge making the blog.
_Edit: Since I ended up using a jekyll template even this point is moot now I guess haha_

As for the kind of content I would like to post here:

1. Maintain a list of projects that I am doing/have done/currently am doing.
2. Some blog posts with my thoughts on various things.
3. Some technical posts on machine learning (Summarizing as I learn for better retention)
4. Anything else I feel like posting.
