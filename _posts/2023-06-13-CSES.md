# Introductory Problems

# 1. Weird Algorithm

Let's try the most obvious solution:
```
void steps(int n) {
    while (n != 1) {
        std::cout<<n<<" ";
        if (n % 2 == 0) {
            n /= 2;
        } else {
            n = 3 * n + 1;
        }
    }
    std::cout<<n;
    return;
}
```
### Result: 

TIME LIMIT EXCEEDED on some test cases.

WRONG ANSWER on some test cases.

Wrong answer probably means some overflow occurred. Let's try changing all the `int` to `long` 
```
void steps(long n) {
    while (n != 1) {
        std::cout<<n<<" ";
        if (n % 2 == 0) {
            n /= 2;
        } else {
            n = 3 * n + 1;
        }
    }
    std::cout<<n;
    return;
}
```

### Result:
ACCEPTED on all test cases!

# 2. Missing Number

This is actually a very simple problem. We can find the sum of first n numbers by `n*(n+1)/2` and just subtract the sum of the numbers we received.

```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>

int main(void){
    long n, sum=0;
    std::cin>>n;
    for(long i=0;i<n-1;i++){
        long no;
        std::cin>>no;
        sum+=no;
    }
    long actual_sum = n*(n+1)/2;
    long missing = actual_sum - sum;
    std::cout<<missing;
    return 0;
}
```

### Result: 

ACCEPTED!

# 3. Repetitions

From what I understood we have to find the length of the longest repeating character sequence without gaps.

Let's try the O(N) approach.

```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main(void){
    std::string s;
    std::cin >> s;
    long len = s.length();
    long ans = 1;
    long max = 1;
    for(long i=0;i<len;i++){
        if(i<len-1){
            if(s[i]==s[i+1]){
                max++;
            } else {
                ans = std::max(max, ans);
                max = 1;
            }
        } else {
            ans = std::max(max, ans);
        }
    }
    std::cout<<ans;
    return 0;
}
```
Result: ACCEPTED!

Nice!

# 4. Increasing Array

`You are given an array of n
 integers. You want to modify the array so that it is increasing, i.e., every element is at least as large as the previous element.
`

So a solution is obvious:
1. Go through all the elements
2. If an element is less than the previous element (if any) we need to increase it.<br>`No of moves required = previous element - current element`
3. Update the current element to the previous value.
4. Add up all the moves required.

```
#include <iostream>

int main(void){
    long n;
    long moves = 0;
    long prev = -1;
    std::cin>>n;
    for (long i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        long val;
        std::cin >> val;
        if (i > 0) {
            if (val < prev) {
                moves += prev - val;
                val = prev;
            }
        }
        prev = val;
    }
    std::cout<<moves;
    return 0;
}
```
### Result: 

ACCEPTED

# 5. Permutations

I need to thank Rupanuga Mishra for the logic for this one. I simply couldn't figure it out :"(

Logic is simple:
1. Loop from `i=0 to i=n/2 (i++)`
2. Print the `ith` and `n/2+ith` numbers one after another

Quick Implementation:
```
for(long i=1;i<=n/2;i++){
    std::cout<<i<<" "<<i+n/2<<" ";
}
// If odd print the last one also
if(n%2==1){std::cout<<n<<" ";}
```
### Result:
FAILED on many test cases.

Seeing the test cases it failed, I noticed a similarity. They are all either:
1. `n==odd` or `n<6`

For `n==odd` the last two numbers were `n-1` and `n` so moving the if statement at the end 
to the beginning should fix it. (Thanks Dhruv!)

For the `n<6` I just added edge conditions (cheating according to Dhruv but it works haha)!
```
#include<iostream>

int main(void){
    long n;
    std::cin>>n;
    if(n==4){
        std::cout<<"3 1 4 2";
        return 0;
    }
    if(n==5){
        std::cout<<"2 4 1 3 5";
        return 0;
    }
    if(n==1){
        std::cout<<"1";
        return 0;
    }
    if(n<6){std::cout<<"NO SOLUTION"; return 0;}
    // If odd print the last one also
    if(n%2==1){std::cout<<n<<" ";}
    for(long i=1;i<=n/2;i++){
        std::cout<<i<<" "<<i+n/2<<" ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```
### Result:
ACCEPTED!

# 6. Number Spiral

Sadly I could not think of any elegant solution to the problem. After looking at it it seemed that the
solution could be found using some elaborate `if-else` blocks and so I did that.
```
// Usage: find_no(y-1, x-1)
long find_no(long row, long col){
    long num;
    // Lower Left
    if (row>col){
        long starting_element_of_row = row%2==1? (row+1)*(row+1) : row*row+1; 
        num = row%2==0? starting_element_of_row + col : starting_element_of_row - col;
    } 
    // Upper Right
    else if (row<col) {
        long starting_element_of_column = col%2==0? (col+1)*(col+1) : col*col+1; 
        num = col%2==0? starting_element_of_column - row : starting_element_of_column + row; 
    } else 
    // Diagonal
    {
        num = row*row+row+1;
    }
    return num;
}
```

### Result:
ACCEPTED!

# 7. Two Knights

This is a O(1) solution because there is a direct formula for the no of positions given a chessboard of some dimension.

Let's say there is a KxK chessboard. We can place two knights in it in `K^2C2` possible ways. How many of these ways make the two knights attack each other?

If two knights are attacking each other, they are at the corner squares of a `3x2` rectangle. In a `3x2` rectangle there are 4 ways we can arrange two knights so as to attack each other. So now how many 3x2 rectangles can we construct in a KxK chessboard?

Translating along the y-axis, we can have `K-3+1 = K-2` positions for the rectangle.
Translating along the x-axis, we can have `K-2+1 = K-1` positions for the rectangle.

Total no of positions where the two knights are attacking each other: `4*(K-2)*(K-1)`

Total no of positions where the two knights are NOT attacking each other: `K^2C2-4*(K-2)*(K-1)`

Quick Implementation:
```
long no_of_ways(long n){
    return (n*n*(n*n-1))/2 - 4*(n-1)*(n-2); 
}

int main(void){
    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(NULL);
    long n;
    std::cin>>n;
    for(long i=1;i<=n;i++){
        std::cout<<no_of_ways(i)<<std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Result:
ACCEPTED!

Luckily there were no edge cases for this problem!

# 8. Two Sets

So, I looked online and found out it is a DP Problem (which I unfortunately never learnt properly during my DSA Course.) Going briefly through some online brief explanations I saw the overall logic.

Let us say we have a set like this: `{1,2,3,4,5,6,7}`
The sum of the elements is `28` so we need to make two sets summing up to `14` each.

# todo!()

# 9. Bit Strings

This is a very simple problem. We just need to find 2^input. This can be done directly using a bitwise operation

```
#include<iostream>

int main(void){
    const long MOD = 1000000007; // 10^9 + 7
    long input;
    std::cin>>input;
    long result = 1 << input;
    std::cout<<result%MOD;
    return 0;
}
```
### Result:
FAILED on some test cases.

Observing a failed test case `input=447` we are getting negative values for both `2^result` and the final answer. We need to find a better way to do the power and % operations.

Luckily on googling I found this: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/exponential-squaring-fast-modulo-multiplication/

Now let us use this method in our code. Basically we find `2^input % MOD` in a series of steps i=1 to i=n each time multiplying our input by 2 and taking the MOD.

The property used is: `a*a % mod = (a%mod) * (a%mod)`

```
#include<iostream>

int main(void){
    const long long MOD = 1000000007; // 10^9 + 7
    long long input;
    std::cin>>input;
    long long res = 1;
    for(long long i=0;i<input;i++){
        res = (res*2);
        res = res%MOD;
    }
    std::cout<<res;
    return 0;
}
```
### Result:
ACCEPTED!
Cool let's move on to the next one!

# 10. Trailing Zeros

Luckily this is a JEE Problem. We need to find the no of multiples of `5` in all the numbers upto the input number as that will give us the no of zeros.

`5` can come as either `5` or any of it's powers. No of occurences of `5^k` in the numbers upto `input` is `box[input/5^k]`

Quick Soln using this:
```
#include<iostream>

int main(void){
    long long n;
    std::cin>>n;
    long long zeros = 0;
    for(long long i=5;i<=n;i*=5){
        zeros += n/i;
        if(zeros==0) {
            break;
        }
    }
    std::cout<<zeros;
    return 0;
}
```
### Result: 
ACCEPTED!

# 11. Coin Piles

So some maths now:
Let `a = coins in left pile`
Let `b = coins in right pile`

We have two options for each of our operations:
1. Remove 2 coins from a and 1 coin from b
2. Remove 1 coin from a and 2 coins from b

Let `x = no of times 1 was performed`.
Let `y = no of times 2 was performed`.

So, `total no of moves = x+y`.

If at the end of `x+y` operations, the two piles became empty, we have two conditions:
1. `a = x*2 + y`
2. `b = x + 2*y`
   
Adding:
1. `a + b = 3*(x + y)`

So, we have 1 condition: That the sum of the two piles must be a multiple of 3!

But, this condition is not sufficient. We have one more also!

Let one pile be incredibly large and the other be incredibly small (less than twice the size of the other)! We keep on removing 2 elements from the bigger and one from the smaller but the smaller pile becomes empty first!!

So, we need to ensure that the bigger pile is no bigger than twice the smaller!

Quick Implementation:
```
#include <iostream>

int main(void){
    long long t;
    std::cin >> t;
    for (long long i = 0; i<t; i++){
        long long a, b;
        std::cin >> a >> b;
        if ((a+b)%3 == 0 && 2*a >= b && 2*b >= a)
            std::cout << "YES" << std::endl;
        else
            std::cout << "NO" << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
### RESULT:
ACCEPTED!
