# Hello There!

Some quick updates regarding the website (Totally not doing this just to fill up the blog ðŸ˜‰):

## Previously

- Github Pages always had the issue of sometimes not re-deploying after making a push. Had to redeploy/unpublish and deploy many times.
- The workflows were irritating. They never worked and instead sometimes messed up the commit history. Plus they were very distracting!
- Pages have to be entirely static. (No API Requests allowed afaik)
- No good analytics unless I add the Google Spyware for traffic analysis.

## Now

As a result, this website is now hosted on Cloudflare Pages!


- I haven't observed any speedups yet but still very excited!
- I can make API calls!!
- There are a ton of apps I can install now on top of the website! (Though they are causing significant slowdown so nvm)
- I have free analytics ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
- I am also using the `sanscript` package to provide transliterations now.


## Also, Transliterable Text ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
