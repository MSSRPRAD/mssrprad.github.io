I am Pradyumna, a third year undergraduate computer science student studying in the Birla Institute of Science and Technology in Hyderabad, India. I wish to learn some technical stacks that have a great future in the industry.

As for what I am doing currently, I am trying to get better at Python and Rust and also (unwillingly) learning a bit of DSA and Javascript on the side.
