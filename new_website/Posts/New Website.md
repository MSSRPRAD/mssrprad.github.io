There are a couple of reasons why the website is undergoing changes:

1. **Appeal:** I rarely posted on the Older Website and was slowly realizing I'd never do it if it required specific time to be set aside for it. Slowly it didn't even feel like **my** website for some reason.
1. **Obsidian:** Recently, I've started using Obsidian to organize my notes and thoughts. Using some wonderful open-source tools like Quartz and Obsidian-Publish, I can now publish my content directly to the web with a small build step. This solves 1. also as the website is populated organically as I keep making these notes without much dedicated effort.
1. **Aesthetic Change:** The old website's styling felt too "professional" xD and made me slightly nauseous. This one is much more satisfying to me personally.

 > These changes align better with my current workflow and I like this design better.
