  - title: PPT-API
    url: https://github.com/MSSRPRAD/ppt-api
    desc: Used openai's GPT-3 to generate a powerpoint presentation from a given text. Used Flask for the backend. Used openai's python library for the API calls. Sadly my API key expired right when I had got the prototype working so the project had to be shelved.

    desc: Tried to make a Forum App in Flask. Made a decent backend but the frontend is very bad. Also the messaging system needs total rewrite using websockets or something similar. The project needs a lot of work and I will revisit it someday but for now, I am including it here.
